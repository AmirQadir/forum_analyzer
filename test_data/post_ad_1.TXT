Depletions   Probiotics; Bifidobacteria bifidum; Lactobacillus acidophilus; Saccaromyces boulardii  Reducing the number of probiotic organisms in the gastrointestinal tract may decrease the body's ability to resist infections and diseases. Symptoms of deficiency include gas, abdominal distress, diarrhea, and yeast infections. 
Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)  Symptoms of vitamin B2 deficiency may include cracks at the corners of the mouth, inflammation of the skin, growth retardation, and impaired wound healing. 
Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid)  Low levels of folic acid have been linked to anemia, heart disease, birth defects, and colon cancer. 
Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)  Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency are rare because it takes years to develop complications associated with long-term depletion of this nutrient. Irritability, weakness, numbness, anemia, loss of appetite, headache, personality changes, and confusion are some of the signs and symptoms associated with vitamin B12 depletion. Low levels of this vitamin may also be associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, heart disease, brain disorders, and birth defects. 
Vitamin H (Biotin)  Low levels of biotin are associated with changes in skin color, inflammation of the skin, hair loss, muscle pain, anemia, loss of appetite, depression, insomnia, and elevated levels of cholesterol. 
Vitamin K  The major symptom of vitamin K deficiency is an inability of the blood to clot properly, which may lead to excessive bleeding and a tendency to bruise easily. 
Editorial Note  The selected depletions information presented here identifies some of the nutrients that may be depleted by certain medications. The signs and symptoms associated with nutrient deficiency may also indicate conditions other than nutrient deficiency. If you are experiencing any of the signs or symptoms mentioned, it does not necessarily mean that you are nutrient deficient. Nutrient depletion depends upon a number of factors, including your medical history, diet, and lifestyle as well as the length of time you have been taking the medication. Please consult your healthcare provider; he or she can best assess and address your individual healthcare needs, and determine if you are at risk for nutrient depletions from these medications as well as others not listed here.
