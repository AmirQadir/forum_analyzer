From The User Man, there is a note that says if PxSEL is enabled, it disables interrupts on that port.


My P1out is not the cause, I have check it, it is CCR0 which is outputing to P1.2. I'll break down what Is going on.


If I start my switches low, the code runs fine, no interrupt is processed.
But if I start with any switches High or switch a switch High, then interrupts are continuous. It is only found when the code is run, since single stepping takes too long for the pwm cycle to go through one cycle.
It is interrupting when bit 3, P1.2, is switched high. Now that bit is not selected as an Interrupt from this line, P1IE = 0xFA, nor is P1.0. But P1IN is changing bit 3 when the piezo goes high. Either way, that change should not enable an interrupt, but it does.
