When Jamie Butler's pigs go for slaughter this winter, he will be keeping his fingers crossed about their weight and condition. The growth-promoting drug he used to put in his animals' feed was banned by the European Union on July 1. He did not replace it with an alternative. And the family business at Whitewool Farm at East Meon, near Petersfield, Hampshire, is looking at other ways of reducing the routine use of antibiotics. It has invested in better buildings for the 350 breeding sows and the 8,500 pigs a year that spend their five to six-month life being weaned, grown and "finished" for the dinner table. 

"We have taken measures to reduce our antibiotic use significantly. We have improved our ventilation and cut our stocking rates. We were giving them things to prevent pneumonia. That can be a headache at times and get really scary. It's the same as humans. They cough, splutter, and don't grow. In severe cases, they die." Mr Butler will still be treating infections as they occur. "It is very, very difficult to farm entirely without antibiotics, and it would cause huge problems, but we must take a responsible attitude towards using them." 

The mixed farm, which has dairy cows and sheep, has an annual veterinary and medicines bill of about  20,000. He is awaiting the results on the growth promoters with interest. "We have changed so much is is difficult to know whether those worked or not." Outdated buildings have been transformed, with thermostatically controlled windows to improve natural ventilation. Mr Butler's farm has also been involved in trials to reduce antibiotic treat ment for mastitis - inflammation of cows' udders. These could be important for the dairy industry, but there are concerns about whether the animals would produce too many white cells, and so make the milk unusable. 

Other farmers already use alternative medicines. Helen Browning, chairman of the Soil Association, the organic watchdog, uses some antibiotics on her pigs but tries to use more natural, complementary medicines. "As we are becoming more skilled we are reducing antibiotic use in some circumstances virtually to zero." Her farm at Bishopston, near Swindon, finishes about 2,000 pigs a year. But more farmers are interested in the new medicines, says Sjaak Brandes, owner of a Dutch-based firm Hyperformance, which has recently entered the British market with cheaper herbal medicines, which it says means antibiotics can be reserved only for acute infections. To fight lack of energy and appetite in a range of animals, it offers a mixture of Russian ginseng, garlic, milk thistle fruit, hearts ease herb, purple coneflower and cat's paw.
