Hey,
I am currently having a problem that P1.2 is causing an interrupt, even though it is not selected as an interrupt and it should also be disabled by nature, becuase when P1SEL is high for a bit, its Interrupt should be disabled.

Has anyone else seen this. You might not realize it until you step through your code, or if your piezo sounds "choppy", I know I heard others sound the same way.


Anyone have any idea why this might be happening?

Thanks,
Matt
