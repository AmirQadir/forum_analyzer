Peptic ulcer

What is a peptic ulcer?

A peptic ulcer is a raw, sensitive patch, like a mouth ulcer, in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum (the first part of the digestive tract after the stomach). In order to start breaking down and digesting the food you eat, your stomach produces hydrochloric acid and pepsin, known as the gastric juices. Because these juices are highly acidic and could therefore digest the stomach lining just as they would any other protein, the stomach is normally completely lined with an inner layer of mucus, which protects it from self-digesting. In people with an ulcer, this layer of mucus does not completely protect the stomach wall, leaving parts of it vulnerable to the gastric juices.

Why do ulcers occur?

Many people with peptic ulcers are infected with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (known as H. pylori). This is a very virulent bacterium that lives in the mucus lining of the stomach wall. It is now thought that most people with H. pylori are infected in childhood and it is usually a life-long infection, although it does not appear to cause any problems in most people who have it. However, H. pylori has been implicated in some forms of stomach cancer.

Infection with H. pylori seems to be just one of a number of factors that combine to make someone prone to getting ulcers. Other factors include high levels of gastric acid (the amount produced varies from person to person), smoking and taking aspirin and certain drugs for arthritis.

Who is infected with H. pylori?

In the UK, at least half the population over middle age is infected. A hundred years ago or more, it is possible that almost everyone in this country would have been infected with H. pylori, and this is still the case in developing nations. The reduction in the rates of infection in the western world appears to be linked to better health and standards of hygiene, as well as smaller families and, therefore, less crowded living conditions.

How are peptic ulcers diagnosed?

Most ulcers are initially diagnosed from the following symptoms:


Localised pain above the navel - pain that is in one specific place, that you can consistently point to with one finger, may indicate an ulcer. The pain is often associated with vomiting.


Pain that starts when you are hungry or stressed, or that wakes you up in the middle of the night. Such pain may also come on gradually over the course of the day.


Food, drink or antacids are likely to relieve the pain.


Weight gain or being overweight - in some sufferers, eating something is the best way to stop the pain, and this can lead to constant snacking, which in turn can lead to weight gain.


Family history - H. pylori infection appears to occur in childhood, so if your parents or siblings have an ulcer or gastric problems it is possible that you may be infected.

Your doctor may also carry out, or refer you for, other tests including:


A blood test - to test for antibodies to H. pylori in your blood


A breath test - to test for the presence of H. pylori in your stomach. This involves swallowing a harmless liquid, which will only be broken down in your stomach if H. pylori is present. The breakdown of the liquid releases a particular chemical, which can then be detected on your breath.


A barium swallow (or meal) X-ray - you swallow a tasteless fluid that then shows up inside your stomach when you are X-rayed (the ulcer will show as a pit in the stomach wall).


An endoscopy - a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat into your stomach so that the doctor or specialist can look at the wall to see if there is an ulcer there. Sometimes a stomach biopsy (when a small tissue sample is taken from the wall of your stomach) may be necessary.

What can be done about ulcers?

There is a lot that can be done to relieve ulcers nowadays. In the case of H. pylori infection, a combination of antibiotics, taken over a course of one to two weeks, usually clears the infection in most cases.

The ulcer will then need to heal (about 4-6 weeks) and this is usually helped by a course of drugs that reduces the level of acid in your stomach. However, the drugs may cause side effects in some people, including nausea, headaches, stomach upset and diarrhoea. If you smoke and do not give up before, during or soon after treatment, your ulcer may not heal.

Are ulcers dangerous?

They can be sometimes, but only if complications occur. Complications are rare, but may include:


Perforation - when the ulcer has eaten right through the stomach wall or duodenum, so allowing gastric juices to escape into the abdominal cavity. This may lead to peritonitis. Symptoms and signs of this include severe pain, a rigid abdomen, shortness of breath, pallor, sweatiness and a rapid pulse. Perforation is very dangerous, and you should get to hospital as soon as possible if you suspect it.

Note also that there is often a false lull in the symptoms of perforation about one to four hours after the onset, when the pain gets less and the sufferer feels a bit better. However, this may be the start of generalised peritonitis and will lead to shock, infection, and may even prove fatal if medical aid is not sought immediately.


Bleeding - when the ulcer eats into a blood vessel in the stomach wall or duodenum, leading to loss of blood. This can then result in anaemia (weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath), fainting and a sudden drop in blood pressure. You may also feel nauseous, even vomit, and the vomit may contain what looks like coffee grounds, but which is actually blood that has been in contact with gastric juices. You may also notice that your stools are darker than normal and tarry, because they contain blood. Bleeding is likely to cause increasing symptoms over time. 


Obstruction - usually occurs as a result of scarring around the site of the ulcer, usually near the exit from the stomach. This causes the digestive tract to become narrowed at this point, so food can no longer pass through easily, which often leads to frequent vomiting and a rapid loss of weight. Other symptoms include tiredness and weakness, as well as changes to the stools (constipation or diarrhoea).

What can I do to help myself?

A bland diet is not recommended for the treatment of ulcers nowadays because it doesn't cure ulcers or relieve the pain, and can actually make you more ill in the long term. Things you can do that will help you include:


Give up smoking - if you smoke, your ulcer is unlikely to heal, and it is likely that you will suffer recurring ulcers.


Moderate your drinking - alcohol, especially spirits, can irritate an existing or healing ulcer.


Reduce stress - stress doesn't cause an ulcer, but it can make the symptoms worse and slow the process of healing. This is because you produce excessive amounts of stomach acid in response to stressful circumstances, which can irritate an existing or healing ulcer.


Avoid foods that upset your stomach - while many people with ulcers can eat anything they want with no problems, some sufferers do find certain foods give them indigestion or reflux (such as fried foods, for example).


Eat small, frequent meals - but don't combine this with the traditional three meals a day as well, or you will soon be battling with a weight problem as well as an ulcer!


Take your prescribed drugs as directed.
